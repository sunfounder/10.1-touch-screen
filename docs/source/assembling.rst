ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

**Step 1: Mount the Raspberry Pi or Other Boards**

Secure the Raspberry Pi (or other compatible boards) onto the back case of the screen. There are two slots provided: a vertical slot and a horizontal slot. These slots are designed to accommodate boards of different sizes. Adjust the nuts and standoffs using the provided small wrench to ensure a snug fit for your board.

**Step 11: Power the Screen and Prepare the Raspberry Pi**

Connect the power cable from your power supply to the main board of the screen. Before powering on, ensure you have followed the steps below to set up your Raspberry Pi:

* Refer to the online tutorials: https://ts-10.rtfd.io.
* Install Raspberry Pi OS onto a Micro SD card.
* Insert the Micro SD card into the Raspberry Pi.

After completing these steps, plug in the power cable to the main board.
