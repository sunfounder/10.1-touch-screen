DIY Stand with Standoffs
==================================

The kit includes two extra **M2.5*18 standoffs** and two **M2.5*30 standoffs**, which can be creatively used to build a DIY stand for the display. Follow the steps below to assemble the stand:

1. **Combine the Standoffs:**

   Take one **M2.5*18 standoff** and one **M2.5*30 standoff** and screw them together to form a longer support structure. Repeat this step to make two long standoffs.

2. **Attach the Standoffs to the Screen:**

   Secure the assembled long standoffs to the two central mounting holes on the back of the screen. Tighten them firmly to ensure stability.

3. **Position the Screen Upright:**

   Flip the screen back to its upright position. The stand, made of **M2.5*18 standoffs** and **M2.5*30 standoffs**, will now hold the screen at a comfortable viewing angle, making it easy to use.
